// CLASSES:
//
// Classes are a blueprint for creating objects. Makes sense, but what's the difference to objects then?
// Ahhh I think I probably understand (first thought I'm having so I can be wrong). To create objects you can have a type already defined, but
// you always need to create the variable and initialize each property inside. I'm assuming the advantage of classes is to being able to create
// new objects without having to type out the entire object and properties every time we want to create a new one, but just say new User(and then
// the values inside that are specific to that instance, which is way easier and faster), specially to create a lot of objects.

// It's like a blueprint for creating objects. We can define all properties and methods that all objects created from this class will have.
// I think I've understood 100% and it's super useful.

class User {
  name: string;
  public email: string;
  private readonly city: string = "berlin";
  constructor(email: string, name: string) {
    this.email = email; // this.email refers to the email variable that we said in the beginning. Same for name
    this.name = name;
  }
}

const hitesh = new User("h@h.com", "hitesh");
hitesh.name;

// But actually, most of the professionals in typescript dont write classes like that. Those are really big and messy.
// The same code can be written as:
// NICEE!

class User2 {
  private readonly city: string = "berlin";
  constructor(public email: string, public name: string) {}
}
//
//
//
// Modifier keywords : PRIVATE, PUBLIC
//
//
//
// There's 3 modifier keywords we'll learn (private and public are 2), and we'll be learning "protected" after

// PRIVATE:
// If we dont want anyone to access the city, we add the "private" keyword.
// It was "readonly" already so we could not change the value, but we could access it. Now with private, we can't access it, gives an error
// hitesh.city //now gives an error

// In javascript we can also call it private using #, which for name would be #name, which would be the same as "private name".
// There's a lot of dicussion in the typescript community if the synthax should be the same as javascript.
// We cant use the private keyword in javascript, just typescript.

// PUBLIC:
// All the properties that we havn't specified as public or private in the class are automatically public.
//         So in which situations is the keyword public useful?
//
//
//
//
//
//
// Getters / Setters:
//
//
// Getters and setters are pretty common, like we use them in javascript. "get" is used to get any property. It doesnt mean we always need to get
// a private property, maybe we want to get a public property "by adding some aditional logic" (think this "" is was what he said).
// But in most usecases this getters and setters are being designed so that any private property can be exposed outside but with some aditional
// logic or aditional restrictions/access. (from hitesh summary in the end of the video)
//

class User3 {
  private _courseCount = 1; //since its private we cannot access this outside of this class, but we can inside of the class.
  protected coursePayment = 10; // I explain the protected keyword in the "inherited" part down there
  private readonly city: string = "berlin";
  constructor(public email: string, public name: string) {}

  get getAppleEmail(): string {
    return `apple${this.email}`;
  }

  // _courseCount is private but we want to design some setters and getters to access it even tho its private.
  // If anybody want to access it must be through the getter or if they want to change it must be through the setter, not directly
  // This is really basic but it could be a lot more complex. We could for example check if there's a unique Id in the user session, and only
  // then we return the course count.
  // From what I'm understanding so far, a private variable you're not able to modify it in the rest of the code, and then you design
  // setters and getters with allowance etc to manage the accessibility to that variable.
  // Looks to me that its also nice because you make sure that through your entire code there won't be a mistake where someone modifies the
  // value for some reason, because they'd have to call the set method and by then they are conscious on what they are doing. But the main reason
  // is probably setting the allowance for who's able to get that value or change that value inside the aplication you're building. Like if the
  // user pays for something, then he can call that. Just wondering, need to see real use cases using classes with privates, getters, setters.

  get courseCount(): number {
    return this._courseCount;
  }

  set courseCount(courseNum) {
    //remember, _courseCount is private so we cannot access it outside of the class, but we can inside of the class
    if (courseNum <= 1) {
      throw new Error("Course count should be more than 1");
    }
    this._courseCount = courseNum;
  }

  private deleteToken() {
    // we can also have private methods, just as we have private properties (properties means the variables in objects, classes etc)
    console.log("Token deleted");
  }
}

const hiteshh = new User3("h@h.com", "hitesh");
// hiteshh.deleteToken(); //its private we can't

//
//
//
//
//
//
// INHERITANCE +  "PROTECTED"
//
// Modifier keyword : PROTECTED
//
//
//
//
// We have declared a class but we also want to use this classes as a parent for another class.
// A lot of functionality is already written and we want to just add a tiny bit of functionality. In such cases inheritance is used.
// We have the class user and we want to create a sub user, imagine there's a family member who also subscribes to our app.
//
// Keyword "protected" here comes into play. If we wanted to change a private property from User3 class like _courseCount, we couldn't, because
// it is a private property. But we can with protected properties. Protected properties are just like private, they cannot be accessed from the
// objects that are created from that class, but they can be accessed through that class (like private), and from any classes that inherit that
// class (which private doesn't).
//
//
//
class SubUser extends User3 {
  // Like this it will inherit the parent class.
  // An object instantiated from SubUser will acquire all the properties from User
  // But there's a problem. It cannot acquire the properties that are "private" in User, because they cannot be accessed from outside the class.
  isFamily: boolean = true;
  changeCoursePayment() {
    this.coursePayment = 30; //this one can be modified or accessed because coursePayment is "protected" in User3 instead of "private"
  }
}

// TLDR of everything around classes, public, private, readonly, protected.
//
//    Classes are blueprints for creating objects. We can define all the properties and methods that all objects created from this class will have.
// Useful when you want to create some objects that share the same structure, but will have different values for each property. Instead of
// creating a type/interface and then you'd have to type all the properties by hand anyway when creating the object, with classes you can just
// say new User3(and inside just add the new values for the properties ).
// When you are creating a class, you create a constructor that defines the properties that can be modified when
// the object that is created from that class is instantiated.
//    Then those properties are "public" by default (you can explicitly say so in order for the code to be more explicit, and by being public,
// they can be accessed from the objects created from that class through ex: hitesh.name, and they can be inherited from other inherited classes.
//      But if you say they are "private", they cannot be accessed in the objects that are created from
// that class, they can only be used inside the class to create the logic. They can though be accessed through getters and setters, which are
// normaly used for that, to manage the accessibility to those private variables. Who can access, what needs to happen so that there's access etc.
// By being private, they wont be accessed in the inherited classes either.
//      Then there's "readonly", which makes it so the variables are accessed
// through hitesh.name for example in the objects that are created from that class, but they cannot be modified through like hitesh.name="john".
//      Then there's "protected", which is really just like private, it cannot be accessed from the objects that are instantiated from that class,
// only through getters and setters, but it can be accessed inside the class (like private can), and the difference from private is that it can be
// accessed inside classes that are inherited from that class, like we did with SubUser. So it maintains all the properties of private, but allows
// any inherited class to use it in their logic inside their class.
